ProCut Steel - Physical Properties and Plasticity

PHYSICAL PROPERTIES:
Density: ~0.284 lb/in³ (similar to other high carbon steels, slightly adjusted for Ni/W content)
Thermal Expansion: ~7.0-7.2 × 10⁻⁶ in/in/°F (typical for nickel-bearing carbon steels)
Thermal Conductivity: ~26-28 BTU/hr/ft/°F (nickel slightly reduces conductivity vs plain carbon)
Modulus of Elasticity: ~30 × 10⁶ psi (30 million psi - standard for carbon steels)

MOVEMENT LEVEL DURING FORGING: 2-3 (on 1-10 scale)
1 = Very easy to move
10 = Very stiff

ProCut movement characteristics:
- Very forgiving and easy to forge
- Wide working temperature range (up to 2200°F)
- Moves similarly to 1080/1084 despite alloy additions
- Easier to work than high-chromium steels
- Tungsten and vanadium additions have minimal impact on forgeability
- Nickel improves hot working characteristics
- Excellent stability during forging - does not crack easily
- Beginner-friendly forging behavior

COMPARISON TO OTHER STEELS:
Movement Level 1-2: 1084, 1095, 15N20 (very easy)
Movement Level 2-3: ProCut, 1080 (easy)
Movement Level 3-4: 80CrV2, 52100 (moderate)
Movement Level 5-7: O1, A2, D2 (stiff)
Movement Level 8-10: CPM steels, high-carbide steels (very stiff)

FORGEABILITY NOTES:
- Wide temperature window provides margin for error
- Does not require precise temperature control like some alloy steels
- Can be forged successfully by beginners
- Excellent for Damascus forging - pairs well with 1084, 80CrV2
- Twisting and pattern manipulation works well
- Deformation characteristics similar to simpler carbon steels
- No special techniques required compared to 1084/15N20

GRAIN STRUCTURE:
- Ultra-fine grain structure achievable
- Vanadium and tungsten carbides "pin" grain boundaries
- Resists grain growth even at high austenitizing temperatures
- This allows wide heat treatment window without toughness loss
- Fine carbides contribute to excellent mechanical properties

DAMASCUS COMPATIBILITY:
- Excellent forge welding characteristics
- Similar movement to 1084 - good match for Damascus
- Replaces 15N20 as bright layer with improved performance
- Higher edge retention than traditional bright layer steels
- Good contrast when etched (bright layer due to nickel)
- Tested successfully with 1084, 80CrV2, and other dark-etching steels
- Forge welding temps: 2100-2300°F typical for Damascus work
- Does not require flux additives beyond standard borax-based flux

MACHINABILITY:
- Easy to work with in annealed condition
- Drillable and grindable without difficulty
- Easier to grind than high-chromium steels
- Can be ground at higher hardnesses (64+ HRC) without excessive difficulty
- Good surface finish achievable
- Does not load grinding belts excessively

GRINDING/FINISHING:
- Easy to grind and finish even at high hardness
- Better than D2, A2, or powder metallurgy steels
- Similar to simple carbon steels in grinding behavior
- Takes excellent polish
- Clean surface finish in Damascus applications
