ProCut High Carbon / Nickel / Tungsten / Vanadium Steel
(Pop's Knife Supply / Larrin Thomas collaboration)

COMPOSITION:
C: 0.866%
Si: 0.215%
Mn: 0.352%
Cr: 0.24%
Ni: 1.99%
V: 0.23%
W: 1.23%

CATEGORY: High Carbon / Nickel Alloy
Damascus Bright Layer Steel (alternative to 15N20)

FORGING TEMPERATURE:
2200°F (1200°C) maximum
Wide forging range - very forgiving
Do not overheat or forge too cold to avoid cracking

NORMALIZING:
1650°F (900°C) for 10-15 minutes, air cool
Can use 1625-1675°F range for forge work
Establish even temperature distribution before cooling

ANNEALING:
1350°F (730°C) for 30 minutes, cool at 100°F/hr to 1100°F (50°C/hr to 595°C)
Alternative: Heat to nonmagnetic and slowly cool in vermiculite

AUSTENITIZING:
Two options depending on desired properties:
- High wear resistance: 1500°F (815°C) for 10-15 minutes (more carbide retained)
- High toughness: 1650°F (900°C) for 10-15 minutes (maximum toughness)

Forge heat treating: Heat to "one shade brighter" than non-magnetic
Grain boundaries are pinned by V/W carbides - resists grain growth even at high temps
Very wide austenitizing range - beginner friendly

QUENCH METHOD:
Oil (most types are fine - Parks 50, preheated canola, etc.)
Good stability in quench - easy to work with

TEMPERING:
Double temper - 2 hours each cycle
Cool to room temperature between tempers

Temperature ranges:
- 300-400°F (150-200°C): High hardness and edge retention
- 450°F (230°C): Maximum toughness
- 350°F (175°C): Balanced performance

Specific heat treatment examples:
- 1550°F austenitize + 450°F temper = 62 HRC
- 1500°F austenitize + 375°F temper = 63 HRC
- 1650°F austenitize + 450°F temper = 61.2 HRC (high toughness)
- 1500°F austenitize + 300°F temper = 64 HRC (high edge retention)

RECOMMENDED HEAT TREATMENT (furnace):
Austenitize: 2050°F (1120°C) - if using advanced equipment
Quench to below 125°F (50°C)
Double temper at 350°F (175°C) for 2 hrs minimum each
Cool to hand warm between tempers
Aim hardness: 60-63 HRC

CRYOGENIC TREATMENT (optional):
Dry ice or liquid nitrogen adds 0.5-2 HRC
Can be done after quench before tempering

NOTES:
- Exceptionally forgiving to heat treat
- Ultra fine grain structure
- Alternative to 15N20 for high-performance Damascus (bright layer)
- Higher edge retention than 15N20, L6, O1, 80CrV2, 1095
- Toughness approaches 8670, 15N20, and 5160 (depending on heat treatment)
- Easy to grind and finish, even at higher hardnesses
- Excellent for forge heat treating due to wide temperature window
- Works well in Damascus with 1084, 80CrV2, and similar dark-etching steels
- Nickel content provides bright etch layer (resists etchant)
- V and W carbides provide wear resistance while maintaining toughness
- Carbon content controlled to prevent toughness drop at high temps
- Developed by Dr. Larrin Thomas (Knife Steel Nerds) and Pop's Knife Supply
