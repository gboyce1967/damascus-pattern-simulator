ProCut Steel - Material Losses During Forging

SCALE LOSS:
Estimated: 1.5-3.0% per hour of soak time at forging temperature
(Similar to 15N20 due to low chromium content)

Scale formation characteristics:
- Low chromium content (0.24%) means less scale resistance than high-Cr steels
- Similar scaling behavior to 1084, 15N20, and other low-alloy carbon steels
- Nickel does not significantly affect scaling rate
- Tungsten and vanadium have minimal impact on scale formation
- Higher end of range (3%) applies to extended holds at high temperature
- Lower end of range (1.5%) applies to efficient forging with minimal soaking

Scale prevention:
- Use anti-scale compound for heat treating in furnace
- Forge in reducing atmosphere when possible
- Minimize time at temperature
- Work efficiently to reduce total heat cycles
- Consider borax coating for Damascus work (serves as flux and scale preventer)

DECARBURIZATION DEPTH:
Estimated: 0.015-0.030 inches per forging session
(Conservative estimate based on similar low-alloy steels)

Decarb characteristics:
- Low alloy content provides less decarb resistance than high-chromium steels
- Similar to 1084, 15N20, O1 in decarb susceptibility  
- Carbon content of 0.866% makes decarb visible after etching
- Decarb appears as hazy or "bling" surface layer
- More pronounced with repeated heat cycles
- Damascus forging with multiple heats increases total decarb

Decarb prevention:
- Use controlled atmosphere (reducing atmosphere preferred)
- Apply anti-scale compound before heat treating in oven
- Minimize exposure time to oxidizing atmosphere
- Forge efficiently to reduce number of heats
- Plan to grind off decarb layer during finishing (typical: 0.030-0.050" removal)
- For thin Damascus, decarb becomes more significant percentage of total thickness

RECOMMENDED MATERIAL ALLOWANCES:

For stock removal work:
- Minimal scale loss (controlled furnace atmosphere)
- Decarb: Plan to remove 0.020-0.030" from surfaces
- Buy stock thickness accounting for surface grinding

For forged blades:
- Scale loss: 2-3% of material mass
- Decarb: 0.020-0.040" depending on number of heats
- Plan bar stock size accordingly (allow extra for scale and decarb removal)

For Damascus forging:
- Scale loss: 2-4% due to multiple heats and long welding sessions
- Decarb: 0.025-0.040" per side
- Plan initial billet size with 10-15% extra material
- More heats = more loss (minimize by working at proper temp and forging efficiently)

MATERIAL EFFICIENCY TIPS:
- Work at correct temperature (not too hot, not too cold)
- Minimize soak time at welding temperature
- Use proper forge atmosphere (slightly reducing)
- Cover steel with flux/borax for Damascus work
- Plan grinding allowance for decarb removal
- Consider that thinner stock loses higher percentage to decarb

COMPARISON TO OTHER STEELS:

Low scale/decarb (better):
- High chromium steels (D2, A2): 1-2% scale, 0.010-0.020" decarb
- Stainless steels: Minimal scale, very low decarb

Medium scale/decarb (ProCut is here):
- 1084, 1095: 2-4% scale, 0.020-0.040" decarb
- 15N20: 1.5-3% scale, 0.015-0.025" decarb
- ProCut: 1.5-3% scale, 0.015-0.030" decarb
- O1: 1.5-3% scale, 0.015-0.025" decarb
- 80CrV2: 2-3.5% scale, 0.020-0.035" decarb

High scale/decarb (worse):
- Simple carbon steels without protective coatings: 3-5% scale, 0.030-0.050" decarb

DAMASCUS-SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS:
- Forge welding typically requires 2100-2300°F
- Extended time at welding temp increases losses
- Multiple drawing and re-welding cycles compound losses
- Each heat cycle adds to total decarb depth
- Plan final thickness considering:
  * Minimum 0.030" removal each side for clean steel
  * Pattern depth requirements
  * Sufficient core material for strength
- A 1/4" thick damascus billet may need 1/8" removed total (both sides) for clean finish
- Start thicker than final desired dimension

ETCH APPEARANCE:
ProCut etches as BRIGHT layer in Damascus (due to nickel content)
- Resists ferric chloride etchant (similar to 15N20)
- Provides high contrast with dark-etching steels (1084, 80CrV2, etc.)
- Nickel content (1.99%) provides excellent etch resistance
- Cleaner surface finish than traditional bright layer steels
- Superior edge retention while maintaining bright etch

NOTES:
- Actual losses vary with forging technique, atmosphere, and number of heats
- Values given are conservative estimates based on similar steel compositions
- Controlled atmosphere significantly reduces both scale and decarb
- Damascus work inherently has higher losses due to multiple heats
- Plan material purchases with 15-20% extra for forging losses and cleanup
