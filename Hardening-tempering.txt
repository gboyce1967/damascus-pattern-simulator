15N20 High Nickel Alloy Steel
Physical Properties

    Density: 0.284 lb/in3
    Thermal Expansion (RT to 600F): 7.1 x 10^-6 in/in/F
    Thermal Conductivity (at 212F): 26.5 BTU/hr/ft/F
    Modulus of Elasticity: 30 psi x 10^6
    Typical Composition: 0.75% Carbon, 2.0% Nickel, 0.40% Manganese.

Forging Movement and Loss

    Forging Range: 1650F to 2100F.
    Movement Level: 3/10 (Moderate). It is slightly stiffer than 1084 due to the Nickel content but remains very plastic.
    Scale Loss Percentage: 1.5% to 3.0% per hour of soak time.
    Decarburization Depth: 0.015" to 0.025" (0.4mm to 0.6mm).
    Characteristics: In pattern-welded Damascus, 15N20 provides the bright, shiny layers because Nickel resists the acid etchant. The Nickel also makes the scale "tighter" and slightly more difficult to pop off compared to 1095.

Temperature Behavior Summary

    Softening Resistance: Carbon steels (1084, O1) begin losing significant hardness above 400F. High alloy/PM steels (CruWear, A2) retain functional hardness up to 900F-1000F.
    Dimensional Stability: Air-hardening steels (A2, CPM 3V, Magnacut) exhibit significantly less distortion during quench than oil-hardening steels (O1, 1084).
    Yield Strength: Generally increases with hardness (HRC), but alloyed steels maintain higher yield strength at elevated temperatures compared to simple carbon steels.
